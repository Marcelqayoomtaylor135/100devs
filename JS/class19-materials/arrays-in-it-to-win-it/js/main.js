//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ["alien", "alien 2", "alien redemption"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let bestMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let moviesSize = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let finalElement = movies[movies.length-1]
